<h1>Symbol Table</h1><p>
An object file's symbol table holds information
needed to locate and relocate a program's symbolic
definitions and references.
A symbol table index is a subscript into this array.
Index 0 both designates the first entry in the table
and serves as the undefined symbol index.  The contents of the
initial entry are specified later in this section.

This member holds an index into the object file's
symbol string table, which
holds the character representations of the symbol names.
If the value is non-zero, it represents a string table
index that gives the symbol name.
Otherwise, the symbol table entry has no name.

<p><dt><code>st_value</code><dd>
This member gives the value of the associated symbol.
Depending on the context, this may be an absolute value,
an address, and so on; details appear below.
<p><dt><code>st_size</code><dd>
Many symbols have associated sizes.
For example, a data object's size is the number
of bytes contained in the object.
This member holds 0 if the symbol has no size or an unknown size.

some section indexes indicate special meanings.
<p>
If this member contains <code>SHN_XINDEX</code>, then
the actual section header index is too large to fit in this
field.  The actual value is contained in the associated
section of type <code>SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX</code>.

<p>
Global and weak symbols differ in two major ways.
<ul>
<p><li>
When the link editor combines several relocatable object files,
it does not allow multiple definitions of <code>STB_GLOBAL</code>
symbols with the same name.
On the other hand, if a defined global symbol exists,
the appearance of a weak symbol with the same name
will not cause an error.
The link editor honors the global definition and ignores
the weak ones.
Similarly, if a common symbol exists
(that is, a symbol whose <code>st_shndx</code>
field holds <code>SHN_COMMON</code>),
the appearance of a weak symbol with the same name will
not cause an error.
The link editor honors the common definition and
ignores the weak ones.
<p><li>
When the link editor searches archive libraries [see ``Archive File''
in Chapter 7],
it extracts archive members that contain definitions of
undefined global symbols.
The member's definition may be either a global or a weak symbol.
The link editor does not
extract archive members to resolve undefined weak symbols.
Unresolved weak symbols have a zero value.
</ul>

<hr>
<img src=warning.gif alt="NOTE:">
The behavior of weak symbols in areas not specified by this document is
implementation defined.
Weak symbols are intended primarily for use in system software.
Their use in application programs is discouraged.
<hr><p>
In each symbol table, all symbols with <code>STB_LOCAL</code>
binding precede the weak and global symbols.
As
<a href=header.html>``Sections''</a>,
above describes,
a symbol table section's <code>sh_info</code>
section header member holds the symbol table index
for the first non-local symbol.
<p>
A symbol's type provides a general classification for
the associated entity.

<DL COMPACT>
<p><dt><code>STT_NOTYPE</code><dd>
The symbol's type is not specified.
<p><dt><code>STT_OBJECT</code><dd>
The symbol is associated with a data object,
such as a variable, an array, and so on.
<p><dt><code>STT_FUNC</code><dd>
The symbol is associated with a function or other executable code.
<p><dt><code>STT_SECTION</code><dd>
The symbol is associated with a section.
Symbol table entries of this type exist primarily for relocation
and normally have <code>STB_LOCAL</code> binding.
<p><dt><code>STT_FILE</code><dd>
Conventionally, the symbol's name gives the name of
the source file associated with the object file.
A file symbol has <code>STB_LOCAL</code>
binding, its section index is <code>SHN_ABS</code>,
and it precedes the other <code>STB_LOCAL</code>
symbols for the file, if it is present.
<p><dt><code>STT_COMMON</code><dd>
The symbol labels an uninitialized common block.
See <a href=#stt_common>below</a> for details.
<p><dt><code>STT_LOOS</code>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<code>STT_HIOS</code><dd>

</dl>
<p>
Function symbols (those with type
<code>STT_FUNC</code>) in shared object files have special significance.
When another object file references a function from
a shared object, the link editor automatically creates a procedure
linkage table entry for the referenced symbol.
Shared object symbols with types other than
<code>STT_FUNC</code> will not
be referenced automatically through the procedure linkage table.
<a name=stt_common></a>
<p>
Symbols with type <code>STT_COMMON</code> label uninitialized
common blocks.  In relocatable objects, these symbols are
not allocated and must have the special section index
<code>SHN_COMMON</code> (see <a href=#shn_common>below</a>).
In shared objects and executables these symbols must be
allocated to some section in the defining object.
<p>
In relocatable objects, symbols with type <code>STT_COMMON</code>
are treated just as other symbols with index <code>SHN_COMMON</code>.
If the link-editor allocates space for the <code>SHN_COMMON</code>
symbol in an output section of the object it is producing, it
must preserve the type of the output symbol as <code>STT_COMMON</code>.
<p>
When the dynamic linker encounters a reference to a symbol
that resolves to a definition of type <code>STT_COMMON</code>,
it may (but is not required to) change its symbol resolution
rules as follows: instead of binding the reference to
the first symbol found with the given name, the dynamic linker searches
for the first symbol with that name with type other
than <code>STT_COMMON</code>.  If no such symbol is found,
it looks for the <code>STT_COMMON</code> definition of that
name that has the largest size.
<a name=visibility></a>
<p>
A symbol's visibility, although it may be specified in a relocatable
object, defines how that symbol may be accessed once it has
become part of an executable or shared object.

<hr>
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<p><dt><code>STV_DEFAULT</code><dd>
The visibility of symbols with the <code>STV_DEFAULT</code>
attribute is as specified by the symbol's binding type.
That is, global and weak symbols are visible
outside of their defining <i>component</i>
(executable file or shared object).
Local symbols are <i>hidden</i>, as described below.
Global and weak symbols are also <i>preemptable</i>,
that is, they may by preempted by definitions of the same
name in another component.
<hr>
<img src=warning.gif alt="NOTE:">
An implementation may restrict the set of global and weak
symbols that are externally visible.
<hr><p>
<p><dt><code>STV_PROTECTED</code><dd>
A symbol defined in the current component is <i>protected</i>
if it is visible in other components but not preemptable,
meaning that any reference to such a symbol from within the
defining component must be resolved to the definition in
that component, even if there is a definition in another
component that would preempt by the default rules.
A symbol with <code>STB_LOCAL</code> binding may not have
<code>STV_PROTECTED</code> visibility.
<a name=protected_resolution></a>
If a symbol definition with <code>STV_PROTECTED</code> visibility
from a shared object is taken as resolving a reference
from an executable or another shared object,
the <code>SHN_UNDEF</code> symbol table entry created
has <code>STV_DEFAULT</code> visibility.
<hr>
<img src=warning.gif alt="NOTE:">
<a name=protected_note></a>
The presence of the <code>STV_PROTECTED</code> flag on a symbol
in a given load module does not affect the symbol resolution
rules for references to that symbol from outside the containing
load module.
<hr><p>
<p><dt><code>STV_HIDDEN</code><dd>
A symbol defined in the current component is <i>hidden</i>
if its name is not visible to other components.  Such a symbol
is necessarily protected.  This attribute may be used to
control the external interface of a component.  Note that
an object named by such a symbol may still be referenced
from another component if its address is passed outside.
<p>
A hidden symbol contained in a relocatable object must be
either removed or converted to <code>STB_LOCAL</code> binding
by the link-editor when the relocatable object is included in an
executable file or shared object.
<p><dt><code>STV_INTERNAL</code><dd>
The meaning of this visibility attribute may be defined by processor
supplements to further constrain hidden symbols.  A processor
supplement's definition should be such that generic tools
can safely treat internal symbols as hidden.
<p>
An internal symbol contained in a relocatable object must be
either removed or converted to <code>STB_LOCAL</code> binding
by the link-editor when the relocatable object is included in an
executable file or shared object.
</dl>
<p>
None of the visibility attributes affects resolution of symbols
within an executable or shared object during link-editing -- such
resolution is controlled by the binding type.  Once the link-editor
has chosen its resolution, these attributes impose two requirements,
both based on the fact that references in the code being linked may
have been optimized to take advantage of the attributes.
<ul>
<li>
First, all of the non-default visibility attributes, when applied
to a symbol reference, imply that a definition to satisfy that
reference must be provided within the current executable or
shared object.  If such a symbol reference has no definition within the
component being linked, then the reference must have
<code>STB_WEAK</code> binding and is resolved to zero.
<li>
Second, if any reference to or definition of a name is a symbol with
a non-default visibility attribute, the visibility attribute
must be propagated to the resolving symbol in the linked object.
If different visibility attributes are specified for distinct
references to or definitions of a symbol, the most constraining
visibility attribute must be propagated to the resolving symbol
in the linked object.  The attributes, ordered from least
to most constraining, are: <code>STV_PROTECTED</code>,
<code>STV_HIDDEN</code> and <code>STV_INTERNAL</code>.
</ul>
<p>
If a symbol's value refers to a
specific location within a section,
its section index member, <code>st_shndx</code>,
holds an index into the section header table.
As the section moves during relocation, the symbol's value
changes as well, and references to the symbol
continue to ``point'' to the same location in the program.
Some special section index values give other semantics.
<DL COMPACT>
<p><dt><code>SHN_ABS</code><dd>
The symbol has an absolute value that will not change
because of relocation.
<a name=shn_common></a>
<p><dt><code>SHN_COMMON</code><dd>
The symbol labels a common block that has not yet been allocated.
The symbol's value gives alignment constraints,
similar to a section's
<code>sh_addralign</code> member.
The link editor will allocate the storage for the symbol
at an address that is a multiple of
<code>st_value</code>.
The symbol's size tells how many bytes are required.
Symbols with section index <code>SHN_COMMON</code> may
appear only in relocatable objects.
<p><dt><code>SHN_UNDEF</code><dd>
This section table index means the symbol is undefined.
When the link editor combines this object file with
another that defines the indicated symbol,
this file's references to the symbol will be linked
to the actual definition.
<p><dt><code>SHN_XINDEX</code><dd>
<a name=many_sections></a>
This value is an escape value.  It indicates that the symbol
refers to a specific location within a section, but that the
section header index for that section is too large to be
represented directly in the symbol table entry.  The actual
section header index is found in the associated
<code>SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX</code>.   The entries in that section
correspond one to one with the entries in the symbol table.
All entries in the SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX will represent valid
section header indexes, even if their corresponding symbol
table entries do not contain <code>SHN_XINDEX</code>.
</dl>
<p>
The symbol table entry for index 0 (<code>STN_UNDEF</code>)
is reserved; it holds the following.

<h2>Symbol Values</h2>
Symbol table entries for different object file types have
slightly different interpretations for the <code>st_value</code> member.
<ul>
<p><li>
In relocatable files, <code>st_value</code> holds alignment constraints for a symbol
whose section index is <code>SHN_COMMON</code>.
<p><li>
In relocatable files, <code>st_value</code> holds
a section offset for a defined symbol.
<code>st_value</code> is an offset from the beginning of the section that
<code>st_shndx</code> identifies.
<p><li>
In executable and shared object files,
<code>st_value</code> holds a virtual address.
To make these files' symbols more useful
for the dynamic linker, the section offset (file interpretation)
gives way to a virtual address (memory interpretation)
for which the section number is irrelevant.
</ul>
Although the symbol table values have similar meanings
for different object files, the data allows
efficient access by the appropriate programs.
